Unity Hotkeys:

ALT + right MSButton (mouse moving in and out) = smooth zoom in/out

ALT + left MSButton = rotate around focus

ALT + middle mouse (or just middle mouse) = pan camera

F = focus

holding V = select vertex (moving at yellow square with left mouse lets you snap to any other vertex)

Shift + V = vertex selection lock (until you press V again)

Cntrl + D = duplicate

E (on object) = rotation mode

W (on object) = precise move mode

Q = hand pan wmode

Edit + snap settings = precise snap controls for translate, rotate, and scale tools

Control + Shift + F (while main camera selected) = Align camera to see current view

Control +  Alt + F (while object(s) selected) = Center objects in current view 

Shift + F = Lock view to current object selected (so moving it will track) (note: you're not permanently locked, rotation breaks it)

Shift + A (select all) + Control + Left-Arrow/Right-Arrow = Expand and collapse hierarchy
Shift + Space = Max current scene

Locking object/selection: Assign it to a new layer (look for "default" and either create a custom one or use one of the defaults, then go to layer-selector (top right "layers" and use the lock symbol to keep it from being selectable (until you unlock it).

Control+Shift = Snap to face
