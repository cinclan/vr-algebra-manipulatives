The following videos serve to illustrate both how the program would function -- using the example problem A+(B+C)/X = Y. 

each letter-variable represents a cube variable of different color:

EX:

A = PINK/REDDISH
B = YELLOW
C = GREEN
X = LIGHTBLUE
Y = DARKBLUE

v# = table iteration, _1

_# = variable being solved for (1 = B (yellow cube), 2 = X (lightblue cube)

The v7_2_CORRECTION video represents the most recent game-board iteration (I deemed it the cleanest and easiest to interpret), and also as a correction to the original v7_2 video where-in I had skipped over a critcal step when the equation a+(b+c)/x = y, solving for y, is at the step x(y-a) = -b-c. The step requires that y-a be divided on both sides, and the CORRECTION accounts for this missing step.
