These images (and models) are to give a sample of the many iterations I went through in order to finally settle on the design v7.

Past models were flawed (would not hold up to all the necessary algebraic manipulation), or needlessly confusing. Some were also visually obscuring and would have been annoying to work on.

Iteration v7 still has major flaws in the design, but for now, it seems to work in simple cases.
