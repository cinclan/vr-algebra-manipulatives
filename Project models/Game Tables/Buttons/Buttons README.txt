Clone_button: clones the two front tables (with purple bases) to the two middle tables (with blue bases). The middle tables are the "manipulation" tables, and are the only tables where the player can actually interact with the cube manipulatives.

Update: updates the cube manipulations in the middle two tables (with blue bases) to the two front tables (with purple bases)

Rotation buttons: on the floor, when targeted, will rotate adjacent table either clockwise or counterclockwise (for better visual understanding).
