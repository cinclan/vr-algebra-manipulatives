The following models are used in most of the walkthroughs to demonstrate what I want the player to always see on the curved wall just beyond the problem work-space.

The menu takes into account the following:

A SCORE: (points are calculated by a culmination of correct moves, a correct final solution, minimal hints, the difficulty and concept, and undo's (the step-back arrow)

The symbols below have the following meanings:

Question-Mark: Returns a hint at the user's current step in the problem (>1 hint on easy problems, >2 hints on medium problems, and >3 hints on hard problems begin to detriment a set amount from the score)

Check-Mark: Checks the answer at any point in the problem (>1 time results in a detriment set amount from the score, as it's intended to be used only when the user believes they are finished.)

Step-back arrow: Steps backward through a problem (to "undo") work (>1 time results in a deteriment to the score.)

Step-forward arrow: Steps forward through a problem up to the most current step being performed by the player (no detriment to the score for using it.)

Black-Die: Randomizes the initial problem to a different one. (If used midway through a game will issue a prompt similiar to "You are about to randomize and *clear* your progress, do you want to proceed?" (Does not impact game-score.)

Exit-Door: Exits to the main menu of the program.

Concept Selection (Isolation, Substitution, Inequality): Switches the concept type (does not affect score, but behaves like Black-Die, and will prompt the user to decide if they want their progress cleared so that a new problem can be generated).

Difficuly: Selects difficulty on a 1-3 level. The higher the difficulty, the larger the potential score, changing the difficulty will prompt if the player wants to clear their progress (as it will require clearing the gameboard and generating a new problem.)
