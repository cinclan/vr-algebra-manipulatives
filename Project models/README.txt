This model is the mockup for the Oculus motion controller, I was unsure of where to find the default asset, so I created my own.

Functionality would work as follows:

Trigger: to drag and drop, and reorganize blocks (wherever laser pointer is aiming)
Green button: to check answer
Red button: to exit
black circle button: one click locks onto a selected variable (or variable combination), then using the trigger, one can individually target other blocks to apply the properties of the selected variable -- in ex: x(blue cube) is in denom, click-lock on it, then using trigger to individually select top var blocks will then apply a multiplication of the x in the denominator.
