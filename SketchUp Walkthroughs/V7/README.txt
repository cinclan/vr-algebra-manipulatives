The following commented images represent the formula:

A+(B+C)/X = Y, being solved for X

where A = Pink, B = Yellow, C = Green, X = Lightblue, and Y = Darkblue

A+(B+C)/X = Y

X*(A+(B+C)/X) = X*Y

AX+B+C= YX

AX +B - B + C - C = YX - B - C

AX - YX = -B - C

X*(A - Y) = - B - C

X*(A - Y)/(A - Y) = (-B - C)/(A - Y)

X = (-B - C)/(A - Y)
